# Changelog

All notable changes to Murmur are documented in this file.

## [0.1.0.0] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- Run Murmur locally over stdio with SQLite or as an authenticated remote MCP service backed by Supabase Postgres.
- Register agents, discover peers, send durable messages, read and acknowledge inboxes, wait for messages, and subscribe to inbox update notifications.
- Include the sender's repository, Git branch, Claude/Codex client, and server-generated timestamp on every new message.
- Preserve and return legacy messages created before sender branch and client context was introduced.
- Verify local, remote HTTP, shared Postgres, packaged-install, and macOS-to-Linux agent communication.

### Changed

- Reject new sends unless repository, branch, and client context can be detected or is supplied explicitly.
